PyStack
*******

Pystack, is a python framework that allow to create small TCP/IP stacks in an easy manner in order to obtain a wanted behavior.
The applications are multiples and there is currently no any module that provide similar functionnalities in python.

It is developped above the `Scapy <http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/doc/>`_ framework to bring some
network stateful functionalities adding to it multiple protocols implementations themselves architectured into a stack which allow the different layers to
communicate. All this **brings the IP stack in userland** and then allow to do anything
on network packets like modifying the network stack behavior without patching the Linux kernel.
