Linux
=====

PyStack has been especially designed to work on Linux. Here are the step to go through in order to get PyStack working:

  #. Be sure the get a python version inferior to 3. Twisted does not work yet on Python 3.
  #. Install all the dependencies which are Scapy and Twisted.
  #. Download the code from Github and put it in your python libraries directory
  #. Run PyStack as administrator

.. note::
    All the tests were performed on python 2.7

Other OS
========

*Windows*

  PyStack can not work on Windows with its current version because it uses netfilter to block certain packets. To get it working on Windows
  the only module to modify is kernel_filter and adapt it to work with the Windows Firewall. Once this is done. You just need to get scapy
  and twisted working and there is no reason that it wouldn't work on Windows. *This as not been tried*

*Mac OS*
  
  The problem for Mac OS is similar to Windows (I think). But it might be simpler to get it working on because Mac OS is nearer than Windows
  of the Linux platform.
